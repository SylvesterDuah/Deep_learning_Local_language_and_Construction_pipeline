If you encounter problems (and you probably will), please do not hesitate to
contact the developers (see below). In addition to specific questions, please
let us know if there are specific aspects of the project that you feel could be
improved, that you find confusing, etc., and which missing features you most
wish it had.

Development pattern for contributors
------------------------------------

1. [Create a personal fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
   of the [main Kaldi repository](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) in GitHub.
2. Make your changes in a named branch different from `master`, e.g. you create
   a branch `my-awesome-feature`.
3. [Generate a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
   through the Web interface of GitHub.
4. As a general rule, please follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
   There are a [few exceptions in Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/style.html).
   You can use the [Google's cpplint.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/cpplint/cpplint.py)
   to verify that your code is free of basic mistakes.

Platform specific notes
-----------------------

### Fedora 41 (and later)

In order to build it on Fedora 41 using the libraries that are provided by the distro, you need to install the development libraries and dependencies with

```
sudo dnf install lapack-devel openfst-devel
```

then build the package as follows:

```
cmake -S ./ -Bbuild/Release -DFETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED=ON -DBuildForFedora=ON
cmake --build /home/gerhard/workspace/kaldi/build/Release
```


### PowerPC 64bits little-endian (ppc64le)

- Kaldi is expected to work out of the box in RHEL >= 7 and Ubuntu >= 16.04 with
  OpenBLAS, ATLAS, or CUDA.
- CUDA drivers for ppc64le can be found at [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- An [IBM Redbook](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp5169.html) is
  available as a guide to install and configure CUDA.

### Android

- Kaldi supports cross compiling for Android using Android NDK, clang++ and
  OpenBLAS.
- See [this blog post](http://jcsilva.github.io/2017/03/18/compile-kaldi-android/)
  for details.

### Web Assembly

- Kaldi supports cross compiling for Web Assembly for in-browser execution
  using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) and CLAPACK.
- See [this post](https://gitlab.inria.fr/kaldi.web/kaldi-wasm/-/wikis/build_details.md)
  for a step-by-step description of the build process.






# Deep_learning_Local_language_and_Construction_pipeline

================================

## Construction Cost Prediction and Speech Synthesis Webapp

## Overview

This pipeline leverages Kaldi for speech synthesis in local languages, specifically designed to assist users in the construction industry. The platform enables users to streamline their construction cost estimation and project timeline by simply speaking or typing in their local language. Our goal is to create an accessible AI-driven solution that doesn't require users to have prior technical knowledge, making it easier for anyone to access the power of artificial intelligence, regardless of their technical background.

By integrating speech-to-text capabilities, the AI can understand input in any local language or even incomplete sentences, processing the information to generate the best possible output for construction cost estimation and project management.

## Key Features

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Utilizing Kaldi's powerful speech recognition system to transcribe spoken language into text, making the platform user-friendly for individuals who may not be familiar with typing or those with language barriers.
- **Localized Language Support**: The system can understand and process input in various local languages, breaking down communication barriers for users in diverse communities.
- **Construction Cost Prediction**: The AI estimates construction costs and timeframes based on the input provided by users, helping to plan and manage projects more effectively.
- **User Accessibility**: The platform is designed to be simple to use. Users can speak or type in their local language, and the AI will handle the rest, offering real-time predictions and estimates.

## Future Vision

Our vision extends beyond just cost prediction. In the future, we aim to build an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**, where the AI will automatically manage construction projects, streamline workflows, and optimize resource utilization. This system will reduce the labor burden and help project managers make smarter, data-driven decisions, ultimately lowering costs and improving efficiency in the construction industry.

By developing this technology, we aim to make AI affordable, accessible, and sustainableâ€”a tool for individuals and communities regardless of their technological expertise. We envision a world where anyone, from a local contractor to a large construction company, can access powerful AI tools to improve their business operations and contribute to better, more sustainable living environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Kaldi**: Speech recognition system used for speech-to-text conversion.
- **TensorFlow**: Framework used for building and training the neural network for construction cost prediction.
- **CycleGAN**: Used for voice conversion, enabling multi-modal interaction (e.g., converting one voice to another or even simulating different accents or speech patterns).
- **Python**: Primary language used for developing the entire pipeline, including the integration of speech recognition and machine learning models.

## Getting Started

To run the web app and make use of the construction cost prediction and speech synthesis features, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x** (preferably Python 3.7 or above)
2. **Kaldi** (Speech recognition and feature extraction)
3. **TensorFlow** (For building and running the AI models)
4. **CycleGAN Model** (For voice conversion)
5. **Dependencies** (Install required Python libraries)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/name/repo-name.git
    cd repo-name
    ```

2. Install Kaldi and configure it for your environment.

3. Set up the `model_dir` with the pre-trained models for speech recognition and cost prediction.

### Usage

1. **Run the Web App**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Interact**: Open the web app in your browser and either speak or type in your local language. The AI will process the input and generate predictions on construction cost and timeframes.

3. **Future Development**: This platform is a work in progress, and new features (like the Agentic RAG System) are coming soon.

### Final Thoughts

By making construction cost prediction and speech synthesis accessible to everyone, we aim to help individuals in local communities, construction teams, and small businesses make better decisions. The future AI systems we envision will be powerful tools for reducing costs, improving sustainability, and optimizing resource usage in various industries. We look forward to the opportunity to make this technology more widely available and impactful.
